# Task Application

This repository contains a simple task application developed using Jetpack Compose. The application is built following modern Android development practices, with a focus on code quality and maintainability. While the UI may be basic as I'm new to Jetpack Compose

## **Features**

- **MVVM Architecture**: Ensures a clean separation of concerns, making the codebase more maintainable and testable.
- **Dagger Hilt**: Dependency injection is used to manage dependencies efficiently and modularly.
- **Retrofit for API Calls**: Handles all API interactions, making the network layer clean and efficient.
- **Jetpack Compose**: The UI is implemented using Jetpack Compose, showcasing the latest in Android UI development. The UI may not be polished, but it demonstrates fundamental Compose principles.

## **Code Structure**

The application is structured around the MVVM architecture, using Dagger Hilt for dependency injection and Retrofit for API communication. The code quality is a priority, even as I learn and implement Jetpack Compose.
